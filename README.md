## Implementation

The app is build with [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) which is a "<em>powerful data exploration & web app framework for Python</em>".

We currently use [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) to convert the app to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). This allows us to serve our app on <em>GitHub Pages</em>.
