k-nearest neighbor

Validate with this is my jam?

Needed files from our side:
- Script for extracting info about song from MSD
    - save information about songs to separate file so we don't have to read all the .h5 files in the MSD subset every time the program is run
    - read the saved info with Pandas, save in CSV format?
- Create k nearest neighbor model
- Create Panel interface as application
    - Search bar that filters song table
    - Somehow choose a song that is added to a list of songs that should be considered in the recommendations
    - Jupyter notebook or Python file runner
- Script for validation in thisismyjam
    - pick users from TIMJ that have liked the original given songs and check if the recommended songs are also in their list of liked songs
    - separate thing from the user interface for using the application
    - process the data to get song -> user -> check if the recommended song is also among the songs of users that liked the song given by the user
